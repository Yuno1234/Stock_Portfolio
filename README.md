## Description
A web application for managing portfolios of stocks that utilizes the IEX API to allow users to search, buy and sell stocks, and view their transaction history. The project involved learning how to retrieve data from an API, sending it to different routes, and writing queries for SQLite. Combining the frontend, backend, and database gave me a comprehensive understanding of web development and how different technologies fit into the tech stack.
